## PowerPoints

They started out as a one-off joke, but I decided to beat it in to the ground.
Certain people in a certain clan which leads a certain alliance get very angry at these stupid things.

Enjoy!

***

#### Encore Alliance [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/Encore_Alliance.pdf)

The very first PowerPoint.
Made in response to a joke about Rayvn's very business-like breakdown of the Encore alliance and Cruma N2.


#### Burls Guide to L2R [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/Burls_Guide_to_L2R.pdf)

Learn about the races, the classes, and why picking a dwarf puts you on an FBI watch list.

#### Burl's Guide to Lineage 2 Revolutio PVP [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/Burl_PVP_Guide.pdf)

The shark-man will show you how to PVP in the rapidly dying phone game called L2R!

#### Legendary Castle Victory Report [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/Legendary.pdf)

This one held up very well.
Legendary sucked at sieges, then F4 was introduced with a server merger and Legendary got a castle.
I put myself in the mind of 2Cheezy and wrote a PowerPoint.

#### Burl's Guide to Einhasad [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/Einhashadas.pdf)

It was a server, which I played on.

#### The Incident [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/TheIncident.pdf)

A tail of deception, backstabbing, spying, lying, and incompetence.
Ariana is the spy, by the way.

#### The Incident - Censored [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/TheIncident_-_Censored.pdf)

Link the normal one, except I redacted everything that would make Ariana/F4 mad.

#### An Introduction to Einhasad: For Grandy Kain [link](https://github.com/BurlL2R/PowerPoints/raw/master/Eininininini.pdf)

Gran Kain merged with Einhasad, so I introduced them to our clans.
lmao F4.
